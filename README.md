Its true. Adverts have to be true but those in charge of the UK are in denial.

Let me explain.

Govt services are absolutely dire. They want to be the lender of last resort to the banks during the financial crisis of 2008, but its the Taxpayer that underwrites the cheques the unelected face of Govt gets their egotistical politician puppets to justify. 

Democracy is simply not logical, electing a bunch of no-nothings because they say the right buzzwords of the day and make promises they cant keep. Before being elected they have no more of a clue of the state of finances of the country than you average man on the street. But once elected, they have access to a cheque book for their pet projects. 

At the same time, the warmongering Ministry of Defence is battling for their NATO % of GDP, like wars & military cost a fixed percentage whether in war or not.

Public Services. Currently a number of city councils are trying to become Unitary Council's. This is simply a Govt form of letting a business go bust to get out of existing contracts and negotiate new contracts. Its a way of covering up bad contracts that existing country councils are locked into. 

I've been over 12months homeless now trying to get back on my feet. The claimant count has gone up but theres been no new jobs advertised to handle the extra claimants. What are DWP staff doing? Getting up to capacity, suggesting they were not worked hard enough in previous years or are they short changing claimants by not actually getting them back into work?

The NHS conditions, I refuse to accept the diagnosis on my patient summary form, but whats even more infuriating, is the conditions I do have they refuse to accept, mainly a bad back. Coupled with being homeless and lugging some of life around in a ruck sack constantly, not being able to maintain hygiene standards and my health is deteriating more quickly and is now starting to challenge my mental health.

If I were to have come out of Prison or have a drug habit, I would be given £100 for leaving prison, housed in a short space of time and given benefits exceeding what I currently get. I get £400 a month, nothing more nothing less. Out of that I purchase patronage to be able to sit and work on my laptop.

I've found JD Wetherspoons, the £1.71 refillable hotdrink and the £2.99 Freedom Breakfast. This buys me about 4 hours a day to work on my laptop from 8am.

The Library on the other hand isnt open until 9am. https://discover.librariesunlimited.org.uk/-/exeter-library#/

St Petrocks which seems to be more of a stop gap for those coming out of prison or have drug habits is opens from 08:30 to about 12:30 Monday to Friday.

I'm sometimes sat in Mcdonalds from 06:30 drinking their coffee as its also a place to sit and work first thing in the morning.

I'm then up the Library around lunchtime but the Library has changed, it seems to be more like a creche for young kids, its noisy, the quiet room is bright, which means my eyes get strained working on this laptop, the Wetherspoons is darker and whilst also noisy in the from lunchtime and evening, is tolerable.

The point being, the DWP wants you to be spending time looking for work, but then provides no facilities in order to do it properly. Ergo you are trapped in the Govt's grasps with very little hope of escaping. Its enough to drive people to drugs, if it wasnt for the fact, life was already bad and more and more people are doing drugs to escape the banality of life because no one asks to be born and Voluntary Euthanasia is still not legal in the UK. Yet the boomers still havent worked out the younger generations dont want to be wiping their bottoms in the last years of their lives. Its a fetish which is slowly dying out in younger generations!

You'll see a lot of the same faces up the library, the same homeless people, sleeping rough. They dont all have drug habits, but the bottom line is the UK doesnt help those back into work unless they cause trouble or go back to Prison and thats why your prisons cost so much. To boost GDP and fat-cat bosses often born with a silver spoon in their mouth because inbreeding hasnt affected their family wealth just yet. Some people milk the NHS and get on the PIP which tops up the money the Govt hands out to people.

To me, it seems the Govt on paper helps people but in practice it just buys off the noisy complainers, trouble makers and drug takers.

Coupled with prejudice and suspicion of anyone new in town, and you have a pretty toxic environment to try to survive. I can see why people of different cultures stick together, but within their own communities they still administer their own forms of punishments, giving people beatings and keeping quiet so the Police dont get involved. Saying that the Police are just as lazy as everyone else, they prefer matters to be dealth with privately, because it helps keep up the public perception that all is well in Blighty to wannabee tourists. Even Starmer recently "doorstepped" Donald Trump when Starmer visited the US and invited Trump over to the UK. It was just to lure the US tourists over to spend their Dollars in the UK. Tourism in the UK dropped 40% last year, so yes Starmer is trying to do his bit to revive the tourism industry, but the method was sleazy for all that could see through it.

The NHS, something thats sold to the rest of the world as a model for healthcare, in reality you are dealing with no nothing GP's who are nothing more than licenced drug dealers. I say this because when prescribing drugs, they are passing liability of the drugs to the drugs companies to stop the NHS from being sued and also to add an air of authenticity to the so called expert nature of their actions. 

In reality, when was the last time your GP asked about your diet, and apart from a few simple tests, they dont really do much. The NHS will make Josef Mengele proud. Sure the settings are not in a wooden shack, but some sort of office, but in reality, you are dealing with a bunch of people who naively got into an occupation where their arms are tied. The Govt dictates what they can and cant prescribe just like the Govt dictates the claims that can be made about supplements, even when more recent studies exist demonstrating new applications or differences of opinion. 

In a way, the Govt is reliant on victimhood. Its reliant on people accepting labels from the NHS or courts, acting up to those labels in order to justify their continued existence and Pittance In Payments (PIP).

If you want to get on the UK, dont come to the UK. Go to another country which hasnt got an aging population who will think nothing of screwing over younger generations like the Pedo's they are, knowing that grandad or grandma will be long since dead before the kids wake up to what has been done to them.

Charities are only good for highlighting the failings of Govt. Govt is happy to have charities filling in the gaps because they can blame the charities and avoid being held to account. Govt's are very good at outsourcing and privatising problems, you can see this when the water companies were privatised, the telecoms and postal systems, or the myriad of services outsourced because some idiot thinks they can do it for a lessor price and creep the standards down slowly.

I'll add more details when I have the time, but it gets to a point where venting is neccessary at least to explain why things are so bad in the UK, and the collective intelligence is going backwards. Not the only country mind. Even Germany is experiencing its own backwardness in standards.

Exeter Library.

Cameron should have closed all the Libraries in my opinion. As a kid I used to frequent Exeter and Crediton Library all the time, I used to read all the Dr Who books I could get my hands on for the bus ride home from Exeter to Crediton, and would get through a Dr Who book a week on average. It meant that Exeter Library used to have a well stock selection of those books. Today however and its changed. Its not quiet anymore and even though they have a Quiet room for people to study, its upstairs but one side is open to the rest of the library and the simple fact of the matter is you can listen in to other peoples conversations with ease. Coupled with windows which dont open so its baking hot on hot days because the window mechanism has been broken for some time and its simply too bright on the sunniest days to see the laptop monitor and it just becomes unusuable as a Public Service. Throw in term time and its crawling with students and you are then hard pressed to even be able to find a seat let alone any peace and quiet. Yet those running these services, paying for these services and the DWP think its an acceptable work environment!!! I guess thats why some school of economic thinking subscribes to the idea that a functioning economy needs a number of out of work individuals. Personally I think its just another way to control people, making an example of them and their misfortune in order to gain compliance and conformity. 

I'd use the job centre to work if their own computers werent misconfigured by some pleb of a company, but sadly the Job centre doesnt want people in their offices looking for work which is why there are countless security guards stalking the floors eyeing you up and theres no canteen or toilet facilities either to spend the 35hrs a week looking for work. The DWP staff even tell claimants to use the Leonardo hotel next door for the toilet, and yet talking to hotel staff, they are not aware of any arrangement for DWP claimants to use their toilets so sometimes you may actually be met with a refusal right when you need the loo the most. Thats pretty degrading as a homeless individual, but the military always remind me how degrading people can be.


When you are reliant on soup kitchens because you cant afford to eat and homeless, some food quiet frankly makes you head to the toilet faster than quark in quantum processor. Whilst fast food is the healthiest compared to restaurants, its a predictable outcome which doesnt leave you wanting stocks in Andrex. Even to this day, I wonder why more places are not fitted with a bidet, if I could have ever afforded to of owned my own home all those years ago when I had money but still not enough to get on the housing ladder unless I lied on the application form, which it transpires many have done, then I'd have had a bidet fitted.

Anyway ironically I've never seen a soup kitchen with less than 5 (https://www.food.gov.uk/safety-hygiene/food-hygiene-rating-scheme) even though some of the food is cooked at volunteers homes and transported in the car to the venue. 

Now the venue is simply some table and chairs in a dead end road which has very little traffic. It gets wet when it rains despite a couple of gazebo's because sometimes the servcies are simply over subscribed with plenty of people turning up.

If you want to score some drugs, this is one sure fire place to get them. Last night I had a couple of blocks sat next to meet who sparked up their spic joints and got hammered. One bloke couldnt even hold on to his cup of coffee and fell fast asleep. You dont get a say if someone is smoking spic around you either because its doesnt really smell of much but before you know it, you are hammered! I hate it because it messes my sleep up and a few days later I get uncontrollably angry. In terms of a chemical weapon, this makes people manchurian candidates. Its nasty stuff but to keep that anger down, you need to keep smoking it. 

Considering I now know most of the people who are with the care of supported accomodation, the NHS or the circle of homelessness, and knowing some of those who smoke spice, what amazes me the most is not that this stuff is being smoked openly in the public, places like the Cathedral green or high street, but that the public walking by or sitting near to these people inhaling the stuff have no clue what they are inhaling. 

This is why I say Spice makes unsuspecting people the perfect manchurian candidate. That works for the Govt because firstly the Police dont drug test people who might be arrested to see if they are under the influence. Likewise the NHS dont drug test people when they present with injuries. I was drugged with something when in the infants one morning break time by an adult with the collusion of my teacher Miss Young, and ended up with a split head. When I look back, the surgeon stitching my head up never once suspected I had been drugged with something let alone asked me. I was just labelled as clumsy, but I've subsequently been drugged on other occaisions later on in childhood and in adulthood. I've never reported them, but the last time was when I was down in Exeter last year. I even walked into hospital told them what happened and got put in a psych room for observation. Nothing was ever found in my blood, but interestingly there is no account of my visit into hospital either on my records according to my GP. I guess thats why they get paid so much, they will do whats neccessary to maintain the income, whilst relying on the general idea of what a GP is, in order to cover up those one off's. An abuse of authority, but not the only ones.

Its also why I'm labelled as having delusional disorder now, because anything I say can be discreditted which is another abuse of authority.

Thats why you see some people just losing it, its cheaper than weed but its behind more of the violent crime than the authorities want to let on!
