Its true. Adverts have to be true but those in charge of the UK are in denial.

Let me explain.

Govt services are absolutely dire. They want to be the lender of last resort to the banks during the financial crisis of 2008, but its the Taxpayer that underwrites the cheques the unelected face of Govt gets their egotistical politician puppets to justify. 

Democracy is simply not logical, electing a bunch of no-nothings because they say the right buzzwords of the day and make promises they cant keep. Before being elected they have no more of a clue of the state of finances of the country than you average man on the street. But once elected, they have access to a cheque book for their pet projects. 

At the same time, the warmongering Ministry of Defence is battling for their NATO % of GDP, like wars & military cost a fixed percentage whether in war or not.

Public Services. Currently a number of city councils are trying to become Unitary Council's. This is simply a Govt form of letting a business go bust to get out of existing contracts and negotiate new contracts. Its a way of covering up bad contracts that existing country councils are locked into. 

I've been over 12months homeless now trying to get back on my feet. The claimant count has gone up but theres been no new jobs advertised to handle the extra claimants. What are DWP staff doing? Getting up to capacity, suggesting they were not worked hard enough in previous years or are they short changing claimants by not actually getting them back into work?

The NHS conditions, I refuse to accept the diagnosis on my patient summary form, but whats even more infuriating, is the conditions I do have they refuse to accept, mainly a bad back. Coupled with being homeless and lugging some of life around in a ruck sack constantly, not being able to maintain hygiene standards and my health is deteriating more quickly and is now starting to challenge my mental health.

If I were to have come out of Prison or have a drug habit, I would be given £100 for leaving prison, housed in a short space of time and given benefits exceeding what I currently get. I get £400 a month, nothing more nothing less. Out of that I purchase patronage to be able to sit and work on my laptop.

I've found JD Wetherspoons, the £1.71 refillable hotdrink and the £2.99 Freedom Breakfast. This buys me about 4 hours a day to work on my laptop from 8am.

The Library on the other hand isnt open until 9am. https://discover.librariesunlimited.org.uk/-/exeter-library#/

St Petrocks which seems to be more of a stop gap for those coming out of prison or have drug habits is opens from 08:30 to about 12:30 Monday to Friday.

I'm sometimes sat in Mcdonalds from 06:30 drinking their coffee as its also a place to sit and work first thing in the morning.

I'm then up the Library around lunchtime but the Library has changed, it seems to be more like a creche for young kids, its noisy, the quiet room is bright, which means my eyes get strained working on this laptop, the Wetherspoons is darker and whilst also noisy in the from lunchtime and evening, is tolerable.

You'll see a lot of the same faces up the library, the same homeless people, sleeping rough, not helping people. They dont all have drug habits, but the bottom line is the UK doesnt help those back into work unless they cause trouble or go back to Prison. Some people milk the NHS and get on the PIP which tops up the money the Govt hands out to people.

To me, it seems the Govt on paper helps people but in practice it just buys off the noisy complainers, trouble makers and drug takers.

Coupled with prejudice and suspicion of anyone new in town, and you have a pretty toxic environment to try to survive. I can see why people of different cultures stick together, but within their own communities they still administer their own forms of punishments, giving people beatings and keeping quiet so the Police dont get involved. Saying that the Police are just as lazy as everyone else, they prefer matters to be dealth with privately, because it helps keep up the public perception that all is well in Blighty to wannabee tourists. Even Starmer recently "doorstepped" Donald Trump when Starmer visited the US and invited Trump over to the UK. It was just to lure the US tourists over to spend their Dollars in the UK. Tourism in the UK dropped 40% last year, so yes Starmer is trying to do his bit to revive the tourism industry, but the method was sleazy for all that could see through it.

The NHS, something thats sold to the rest of the world as a model for healthcare, in reality you are dealing with no nothing GP's who are nothing more than licenced drug dealers. I say this because when prescribing drugs, they are passing liability of the drugs to the drugs companies to stop the NHS from being sued and also to add an air of authenticity to the so called expert nature of their actions. 

In reality, when was the last time your GP asked about your diet, and apart from a few simple tests, they dont really do much. The NHS will make Josef Mengele proud. Sure the settings are not in a wooden shack, but some sort of office, but in reality, you are dealing with a bunch of people who naively got into an occupation where their arms are tied. The Govt dictates what they can and cant prescribe just like the Govt dictates the claims that can be made about supplements, even when more recent studies exist demonstrating new applications or differences of opinion. 

In a way, the Govt is reliant on victimhood. Its reliant on people accepting labels from the NHS or courts, acting up to those labels in order to justify their continued existence and Pittance In Payments (PIP).

If you want to get on the UK, dont come to the UK. Go to another country which hasnt got an aging population who will think nothing of screwing over younger generations like the Pedo's they are, knowing that grandad or grandma will be long since dead before the kids wake up to what has been done to them.

Charities are only good for highlighting the failings of Govt. Govt is happy to have charities filling in the gaps because they can blame the charities and avoid being held to account. Govt's are very good at outsourcing and privatising problems, you can see this when the water companies were privatised, the telecoms and postal systems, or the myriad of services outsourced because some idiot thinks they can do it for a lessor price and creep the standards down slowly.

I'll add more details when I have the time, but it gets to a point where venting is neccessary at least to explain why things are so bad in the UK, and the collective intelligence is going backwards. Not the only country mind. Even Germany is experiencing its own backwardness in standards.
